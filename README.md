## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 

I feel that I should get all 20 points this week for this assignment because I actually completed this weeks assignment completely. And I got help from Professor Gilany who helped explain a lot for me.

For the Storage lab assignment I feel like I should get 14/20 points because I had everything working until the dark mode, in which I almost had it working.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->

This weeks assignment was a good assignment to show what we learned this week. I gained more knowledge than I had before thanks to Professor Gilany.

The Storage lab assignment was a somewhat short lab that has us use localStorage and other things we learned during the week. It was a decent lab.

### How long it took me to finish this?

1.5 hours

Storage Lab: 2 hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It adds preset classes to help with formatting of the web page.
